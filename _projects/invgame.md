<h2>What is the inverse game problem?</h2>

Inverse games is the problem of inferring the playersâ€™s motives from their decision histories in noncooperative interactions. Such an inference explains the behavior of other decision makers and, perhaps more importantly, predict their future actions. Solving the inverse game problem can help us predict, for example, whether a basketball player will take a shot when double-teamed, whether a pocker player will call a bluff, how drivers shift their behavior when facing unexpected congestion, and how cyberattacks plan their strategies when presented with different honeypots.
