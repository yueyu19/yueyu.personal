**NASA is using the algorithm we developed!** According to NASA's technical report, the proportional integral projected gradient method, an algorithm developed by my collaborators and I, **provides five times faster computation using only one tenth of the lines of code when compared with the previous state-of-the-art!** Read about it in the NASA's [annual project review](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230011737) and learn more about it in [our paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2023-2003)!
