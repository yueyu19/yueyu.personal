I am a postdoc at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin. My advisor is [Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I obtained my PhD degree from Univsersity of Washington. My PhD advisor is [Behcet Acikmese](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). 

Research interests
------

My research interests are on the intersection of optimization, game theory, control theory, and amchine learning. I develop numerical optimization solvers to enable real-time decision-making in autonomy, data-driven control methods for dynamical systems with unknown governing equations, and mechanisms to mitigate the conflicts in multiagent interactions.
